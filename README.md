# Movie_Recommender_System

Recommender systems are algorithms designed to help users discover movies, products, and songs by predicting the userâ€™s rating of each item and displaying similar items that they might rate high as well.

The objective is to show customers content that they would like best based on their historical activity. 

**ITEM-BASED** collaborative filters work by recommending elements based on relationship between items and not people.

The recommender system is now designed based on items (such as movies) and not users.

This reduces the complexity of the problem and overcomes the challenges of **USER-BASED** collaborative filtering.

Unlike humans, movies, songs, and products features and tastes do not change over time.
